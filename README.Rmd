# ecpdist

`ecpdist` is a package for working with the Chen and the Extended Chen-Poisson 
Lifetime Distributions. It provides functions to compute:

- Cumulative distribution, survival, density, hazard, and cumulative hazard 
functions 

- Quantile function

- Graphics for these functions 

- Random samples

- Measures of skewness and kurtosis

- *k*-th raw moments and conditional *k*-th moments 

- Mean residual life function 

More features may be added soon!

## Installation

### Development version from GitHub

To install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/abreu-uma/ecpdist), run:

``` r
# If you haven't already installed devtools, you may need to install it first:
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("abreu-uma/ecpdist")
```

### From CRAN (still does not have the Chen distribution)

You can install the previous released version of `ecpdist` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ecpdist")
```
