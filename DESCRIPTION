Description: Computes the Extended Chen-Poisson (ecp) distribution, survival, 
    density, hazard, cumulative hazard and quantile functions. It also allows 
    to generate a pseudo-random sample from the ecp distribution. The 
    corresponding graphics are available. Functions to obtain measures of 
    skewness and kurtosis, k-th raw moments, conditional k-th moments and mean 
    residual life function were added. Some more functions can appear soon!
