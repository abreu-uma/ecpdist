Extended Chen-Poisson Lifetime Distribution

ecpdist is a package that computes the values of the cumulative distribution, 
survival, density, hazard, cumulative hazard and quantile functions of the 
Extended Chen-Poisson Lifetime Distribution. The corresponding graphics are now
available. Functions to obtain measures of 
    skewness and kurtosis, k-th raw moments, conditional k-th moments and mean 
    residual life function were added. Some more functions can appear soon!
